## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Senior Software Engineer @ Improbable

> Canada (Remote) | January 2020 – Present

In the Online Services group I am leading a small cross-cutting team developing web-based admin panels for managing different products offered by the IMS (Improbable Multiplayer Services). My goal aside from delivering features to our customers is to create a foundation of React-based tools and best practices for developing UIs that can be easily distributed across different product teams while providing a consistent and modern experience for our customers.

Additionally, I have contributed to real-time game services such as multiplayer lobby (Node/TypeScript), authentication (Go) and in-game chat (ejabberd/XMPP). I am also involved in managing our infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, Docker), CI/CD systems (Buildkite, GitHub Actions) and metrics (Prometheus, Grafana, Kibana).

### Senior Software Engineer @ Blizzard Entertainment

> Irvine, CA | January 2016 – January 2020 (4 years)

In the Web &amp; Mobile department I spent 4 years delivering high quality web experiences for players. Some of these projects included _BlizzCon_, _Overwatch_, _Overwatch League_, and _Overwatch Contenders_. Some of the requirements I worked with regularly were mobile-first design, CMS-powered content, functional styleguides, internationalization, browser &amp; device support, performance, SEO, and pixel-perfect design execution.

On top of product development I also helped to guide the technical direction of the web organization. Migrating from Java to Node for easier API development and maintenance meant building out shared middleware and libraries that other teams used. I introduced front-end technologies like SCSS and React in order to keep up with the demanding interactivity of our sites. Moving to the cloud was also a big departmental focus, so I was actively working with AWS, Docker, Jenkins, Spinnaker, etc to make that transition.

Additionally, I spent some time working on the _Starcraft: Remastered UI_ which blended web technologies (Preact) with the game client via CEF. Building a web UI to match the look and feel of a 20 year old game had some interesting hurdles, but overall it was very successful.

Lastly, an interesting project I spent my final year on was an internal React-based WYSIWYG website builder. The goal of the project was to enable designers to quickly put together standalone marketing pages using re-usable blocks that still had the power of an engineered website. Imagine a tool like Figma where your prototypes "compiled" to React and can utilize React components made by developers. It was used successfully in production at least a few times before I left, including the _Diablo: Immortal_ website.

### Web UI Developer @ Cineplex Digital Networks

> London, ON | June 2014 – December 2015 (1.5 years)

At CDN (known as "EK3" before Cineplex acquired the company) I was mainly involved in a new project to realize the potential of an interactive kiosk system for retail stores. We worked with an inventory of tablets designed for commercial use which ran various web content in a stripped down Android OS, for example an in-store catalog that customers could use to find the items they're looking for. Most of my contributions here were in the back-end management system (Java Spring) that communicated with the inventory of tablets and allowed administrators to remotely control devices (update content, reboot device, etc).

Another piece to this project that was built from scratch while I was on the team was introducing interactive marketing content to these devices. I developed the web framework for the content which was a combination of videos and images created by our marketing team, stitched together with interactive zones into sort of a storyboard user flow. This allowed customers in the store to physically engage and learn about a product that would be right there on the shelf next to the device.

### Solutions Developer @ GoodLife Fitness

> London, ON | January 2013 – June 2014 (1.5 years)

At GoodLife I worked on the fitness club management system used across the company at over 300 locations. The system was initially developed in ASP with a SQL Server data layer. I maintained some of the original ASP features and also developed some of the first ones done in ASP.NET MVC. This technology was also used to develop some customer-facing solutions such as a stream-lined 14-day Trial Membership sign-up for customers.

I also lead a sizable effort to redesign the entire look and feel of the core system using Bootstrap and a custom theme that matched the company's new brand, as well as migrating from VBScript to JavaScript. The main drive was to modernize and unify the UI so the system was easier to use by club employees and could run on modern browsers. It started as a hackathon idea that I was able to push forward and get buy-in from our director and VP to fund the project.

### Software Developer (co-op) @ BlackBerry

> Waterloo, ON | May 2012 – August 2012 (4 months)

Collaborated on porting SlipStream's proxy client (C/C++) from Linux to QNX. Mainly I developed a tablet-optimized web interface for managing configuration settings.

### Software Developer (co-op) @ Info-Tech Research Group

> London, ON | September 2011 – December 2011 (4 months)

Worked on small improvements to the core client-facing website built with Ruby on Rails and also worked on some features in SalesForce. This job also introduced me to many modern development methodologies and tools such as Agile Scrum and Git source control.

### Web Developer (co-op) @ Lawson Research Institute

> London, ON | December 2010 – April 2011 (4 months)

Worked on a secure patient portal for capturing data in medical studies. I was involved in all aspects of the project which was done in JavaScript, PHP (CodeIgniter), and MySQL.
